  JavaScript applications.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  To view your deployment, you should be able to navigate to the load balancer IP
  address in your browser. To configure DNS, please refer to this
  [documentation](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on how to setup your Hosts file to allow your browser to access your
  Deployment via a domain name.

  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Node.js, the [Node
  wiki](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki) provides resources and
  documentation for all things Node related.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Packages
  There are many third-party packages that can be installed to supplement the
  base Node install. To do so, you need to use a package manager. The defacto
  Node package manager is called npm, and it is installed with Node. All of the
  avaiable Node packages can be viewed and searched for on [the npm
  website](https://npmjs.org/). To install a package, open a terminal and type
  'npm install [INSERT_PACKAGE_NAME_HERE]'.

  #### Generic Node Stack Installation
  If you do not provide a git repository from which to deploy your application,
  a generic Node stack will be installed for you. In addition to Node and npm,
  the following useful npm packages will be installed:
  [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect),
  [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express),
  [optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist),
  [passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport),
  [underscore](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore),
  [mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose)
  [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever), and
  [jslint](https://github.com/reid/node-jslint). A sample application will be
  installed in the provided application directory, or '/var/app' if one is not
  provided. To verify the application is running, navigate to the newly-created
  server's IP address and port (i.e. 123.456.78.90:80). You should see the
  phrase 'This is a landing page'; Adding '/hello' to the end of the url should
  take you to a page that reads 'Hello [YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE]!'
